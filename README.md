Please generate drivers , with .ioc file.

Here is a SD Card Data Logger Test Dode uses SDIO for STM32 microcontrollers.

0.96 Inch ST7735 LCD shows the process and give information.

1-Start:

![sd card 01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5a2f61d-4551-4770-a24e-d725a9b022a5)

2-Mount SD Card:

![sd card 02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d82468c-17d8-4657-9e68-fdbf4edebc76)

3-Generate .txt files:

![sd card 03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98906f1f-cb83-4825-9fb2-67bb568d6ad0)

4-Record data to the files:

![sd card 04](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6bdf440-a957-4fbb-862c-7198f7c4c033)

5-Unmount SD Card:

![sd card 05](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59422263-4f14-4512-ac53-4e6d57d87a30)

6-End:

![sd card 06](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44f8f235-dbac-43c2-a499-4a2d94665981)

Here is results:

I created a back-up file just in case, you can remove or add other functions.

Other functions can be found in File_Handling.c file.

Also, you can use uart to follow up the code.

A SD Card helps you to detect errors with few pin connections.

Hope this helps you,
